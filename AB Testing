In this project, I compared two different versions of two different campaigns each – Black Friday Version 1 and 2 and New Year Version 1 and 2 campaigns.
The goal was to calculate conversion via impression to click data, and to conclude whether the versions had a significant difference in conversion rates.

Using my statistical knowledge and the binomial A/B test calculater, I came to the conclusion that the difference between New Year campaign versions was significant –
I couldn't reject the null hypothesis and accepted the alternative hypothesis. (The control group did worse than the experimental group.)
Meanwhile, the Black Friday campaign versions were insignificantly different, both for 95% and 99% confidence. The null hypothesis was proven here.

-- To ensure that we're only interested in rows where one of the campaign versions is _V1 and the other is _V2, and they occur in the same month.
-- REPLACE is used to derive the name of the corresponding _V2 campaign if we have a _V1 campaign, and vice versa.
