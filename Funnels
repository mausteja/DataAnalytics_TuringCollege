In this project, I used BigQuery to select 3 top selling countries to build funnel models for each of them, based on chosen events: 
first_visit
add_to_cart
add_payment_info
purchase
select_promotion

I then used both Google Sheets and Tableau to visually represent the funnel data (%),
and draw insight from the data.
