For this intricate project, I looked into healthcare data with a view to building a predictive 10-year heart disease model.

The data was first cleaned and ammended (where possible), then divided into two groups (main 80% / test 20%).

Using statistical software Gretl, I used logistic modeling to try out different models, removing least significant variables based on the p value.
(Low p value denoting high significance.)

I build an Accuracy, Presicion and Recall table based on different threshold probabilities (i.e. when a patient would be said to have a disease).
In the medical sphere, it's important to have high recall, or true positives, meaning that it's better to identify as many ill individuals as possible,
even if it means temporarily misidentifying individuals who actually do not have the disease.

According to the final model, the most significant factors for developing heart disease in 10 years were: 
1) age 2) being male 3) having medical history with systolic blood pressure 4) high glucose levels 5) smoking >X cigarettes per day
