For this project I continued working with SQL, spreadsheets, and Tableau to conduct a weekly cohort analysis
of a subscription based product.

Task + SQL code:

Tableau viz:

Some insights:
- Christmas and New Year period attests to the rise of new subscribers
- Highest retention is seen during the Christmas period
- US market dissolves after the first few months (with no new subscriptions later on)
- > 50 % of subscriptions come from desktop purchases
